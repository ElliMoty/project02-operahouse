# PROJECT 2 - Opera House - Server

## Intro
This is the back-end server for an Opera House website. This serves mostly as an API form which the front end can send and pull data. The database uses 6 models to create a user booking system for events at the Opera House, where a user can book a seat for an event in an event space. The front end can use axios post and get requests to the back-end to update the database.

## LIVE SITE
[Click here](https://operahouse-server.herokuapp.com/) for the live site. However the site functions as purely a server and is not necessarily for user interaction.

## The Database
This database uses 6 models; Categories, Events, Event Spaces, Seats, Bookings and Users. All the models have many-to-one associations. This database was build using Ruby on Rails.

## Technologies
- SQL
- PostgreSQL
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- HTML
- JWT
- Knock

## For the future
This project is still a work in progress, however as of now the back-end is mostly completed. The remaining work needed is more seed data and a tighter grip on user access vs public access.
