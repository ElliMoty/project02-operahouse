Pure passion and brilliant voices.', :long_desc => "Werther loves with thrilling intensity. But passion blooms into a dangerous obsession when the young poet discovers his love can never be realised. Goethe’s powerful novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, moved the world upon its release in 1774. Young men cried their anguish into tiny glass vials and carried around their tears to prove the depth of their emotions. They wore the poet’s signature clothes, and a few lovelorn souls even followed his path, seeking death over a life without love. In the ultimate Romantic opera, Massenet’s rich score magnifies the drama and emotion of the story. Werther falls hopelessly in love with Charlotte in lyrical, melodious phrases. As Charlotte chooses duty over heart, Werther’s turmoil is palpable in restless music that bursts out of an enormous orchestra. The French composer’s ability to evoke mood and moment in music is on brilliant display. Any tenor that can master the psycho-logical range and musical difficulty of Werther is guaranteed a new signature role. Young star, Michael Fabiano, is renowned for his intense, character-driven performances. Hear his role debut as the troubled poet, with acclaimed mezzo-soprano Elena Maximova as Charlotte and Carlo Montanaro as conductor."

Taras Bulba is Janáček’s homage to the fearless spirit of Russia, personified by the 16th-century Cossack hero.

Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra is a modern classic – a sensational showcase for a hundred brilliant musicians in full flight, especially in the thrilling whirlwind of a finale. Steve Reich’s iconic minimalist works have influenced classical, electronic and pop music.

This acclaimed work will have its New York premiere at the Joyce Theater in May. Stephen Baynes’ Constant Variants mirrors the elegant classicism of Tchaikovsky’s Variations on a Rococo Theme with velvet-soft, delicate dance. Gliding airborne, captured in warm light and vast picture frames, his dancers conjure the mesmerising beauty of Renaissance paintings. Verve ends with a bang: Tim Harbour’s Filigree and Shadow, the hit of our 2015 contemporary program. The stripped-back clarity of its set, designed by Sydney architect Kelvin Ho, contrasts with the ferocious complexity and speed of the choreography and the drama of the specially commissioned electronic score by German duo 48nord.
